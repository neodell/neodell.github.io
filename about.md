I am currently a PhD candidate at NC State University in the Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management. 

# How I got here
Prior to embarking on my doctorate degree, I earned a master’s degree in Health Promotion from the University of Colorado Colorado Springs. The journey to get there follows…

I've wandered through a few states - growing up in Florida, passing through Illinois, and finally settling in Colorado - with a career path that's been anything but straight and narrow. I started out with undergraduate and master’s degrees in chemistry. I then worked for a few years in higher ed in academic advising and career services roles. While at the time it was just something I did in my spare time, important to my story is that I was training in Taekwondo, earned two black belts and teaching classes as a certified instructor.


After a move to Colorado I had an opportunity to get back into a technical field and worked in the semiconductor industry as a photolithography process engineer. During that time I began to explore endurance sports through a charity opportunity (I had a bike, I sort of knew how to swim, and well, if I can walk I can run) and found I enjoyed triathlon more than taekwondo. I became a triathlon coach and during a downturn in the semiconductor industry, I decided to expand my triathlon coaching business - turning my enjoyment of staying active into a way to help others level up their fitness and health.


During some time working for a national non-profit (for some income stability and a cause I support), I did some deep reflection and decided I needed to go back to school to learn more about supporting physical activity in our communities. My master’s degree experience led me to want to understand how we can design communities that actually encourage people to move more. So now I’m a PhD student studying how our built environment and policies can either support or limit physical activity. It is exciting work that feels like it could genuinely make a difference in how people live and move.

# What about bikes
Woven into the above story is a love for the bicycle and the freedom and opportunities it provides for transportation and recreation. I grew up in an era where a lot of us had bikes as kids and used them to get around. While the bike was never centered in my life until my triathlon days, it was almost always present. I find something freeing about being able to ride a bike rather than drive. The physical and environmental health benefits are a big plus.


My interest in human powered transportation got me involved with local bicycle advocacy groups. For example, I had the privilege of representing [BikeCOS](https://www.bikecoloradosprings.org/) on the Colorado Springs long term transportation plan Citizen Advisory Committee.


# What I do for fun
- Getting outside! 
  - While in North Carolina I’m trying to explore parks and trails in different parts of the state. 
  - Living in Colorado is magical. While I don’t compete in triathlons any more, you might just find me out running on the local trails with my husband. And of course you’ll also see me out and about on a bike.
- I also enjoy playing drums and the bass guitar.
