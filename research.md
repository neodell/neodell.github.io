I am interested in how the built environment, shaped by land use and transportation policies, influences physical activity behavior and can support healthy, sustainable communities. 

### Dissertation
**Pathways to Active Communities: A mixed-methods examination of Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Committees in the United States.**

*My dissertation examines municipal bicycle and pedestrian advisory boards, using spatial, quantitative, and qualitative methods to understand their role in shaping active transportation policies.* Encouraging physical activity through active travel modes can have an impact on the risk of non-communicable disease. Changes to the built environment that support active travel modes for all ages is an accepted strategy for improving the quality of life for all. Furthermore, communities that support bicycling, walking, and public transit use can see economic and environmental benefits. Policies that support these changes often need to happen at the local level. However, local decision makers are not experts on all policy matters, and municipalities may create a bicycle and/or pedestrian advisory board to advise on such issues. However not much is known about these boards, committees, or commissions (BPACs). With this dissertation, I will explore the spatial landscape of BPACs across the United States and examine associations of BPACs and physical activity supportive zoning. Furthermore, I seek to understand the perceptions of BPAC members on their influence of bike/ped policy decisions through qualitative inquiry.   

### Other Current Projects
**CDC High Obesity Program Graduate Research Assistant** 
I am working with the physical activity strategy of the NC State HOP grant. This project is funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and seeks to increase physical activity through community design. We are working with ten primarily rural counties to understand their unique structural barriers to physical activity and how, through university Extension and other partnerships, we can provide assistance or support for improving the number and/or quality of transportation, land use, and recreation policies.

**PAPREN Transportation Policy and Planning WorkGroup Project**

*Is Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) associated with transit access?* I served as Fellow for the Physical Activity Policy Research and Evaluation Network, ([PAPREN](https://papren.org)) Transportation Policy and Planning Workgroup for the 2023-24 funding cycle. We examined associations of Transit-Oriented Development policy with access to transit via transit stop density and active travel behavior. My role in the project was to calculate transit stop density using data from the national transit stop database for places in a curated dataset that also contained zoning policies from 38 states and DC. The statistical analysis was performed by researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago. We are now in the manuscript preparation phase.

### Past Projects
**Micromobility on the NC State Campus** Micromobility (e.g., e-scooters) is becoming a more popular travel mode in urban areas, including urban university campuses. NC State contracts with a micromobility provider for dockless e-scooters and e-bikes. For the 2023-24 academic year, I was the graduate research assistant on this project, funded by SPIN, to understand micromobility use patterns, travel behavior, and perceptions of the safety on campus. I presented findings at the Association of Pedestrian & Bicycle Professionals conference in August 2024, as well as provided SPIN and the NC State Transportation Department a summary of findings and recommended actions.

**Participation in Green Social Prescriptions**
Green social prescriptions, also called nature or park prescriptions, are a strategy for medical providers to prescribe health-improving behaviors rather than pharmaceutical interventions. Prior to my arrival at NC State, Dr. Hipp was part of a collaborative project funded by the University Global Partnership Network to explore participant experiences, preferences, barriers, and participation likelihood of green social prescriptions. I worked on data analysis and communicating findings related to:
- Barriers (Presented at 2023 Active Living Conference)
- Preferences (Presented at 2023 American Public Health Association Annual Meeting)
- Participation likelihood (Presented at 2024 Active Living Conference and published in Journal of Healthy Eating and Active Living)

**Evaluation Coordinator - NC Year of the Trail Campaign**
During my first year and a half at NC State, I supported the
[NC Year of the Trail campaign](https://greattrailsnc.com/2023-is-the-nc-year-of-the-trail/) as the evaluation coordinator. I kept track of programs that were taking place across the state so they understood the programmatic characteristics and impact of the campaign. I helped create and maintain a GIS dashboard and  also evaluated economic equity of the campaign using the NC’s [measure of economic distress](https://www.commerce.nc.gov/grants-incentives/county-distress-rankings-tiers). That work was presented at ALC 2024 and the NC State College of Natural Resources Student Research Showcase.
